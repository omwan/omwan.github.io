                        In the spring and summer of my freshman year, I worked as an intern for Parameters, a music technology startup funded by Northeastern’s IDEA Venture program. I worked mostly on front end components of their web application product, using AngularJS, HTML/CSS, and Firebase. Through this experience, I gained an introduction to web application development and the software development industry, as well as insight into how startups work.

                        For multiple semesters now I’ve worked as a course assistant in the College of Computer and Information Science at Northeastern University, for the course Logic and Computation. The course focuses on writing proofs and theorems about programs using ACL2s, a derivative of Lisp. As a course assistant, my role was to hold weekly office hours to assist students in their understanding of course concepts, grading weekly group programming assignments and exams, and assisting with the creation and development of homework and exam materials.

                        This past fall I’ve volunteered as a facilitator for a Girls Who Code club run at the College of Computer  and Information Science at Northeastern University. Girls Who Code is a nationwide organization with a mission to introduce girls to computer science, and foster a supportive community of female programmers. As a facilitator, my role was to lead weekly club meetings where students worked collaboratively to build an impact project to help their community, as well as smaller lessons on programming languages and tools such as HTML/CSS and GitHub.
