                            <h2>Parameters Website</h2>
                            <p>During my internship at Parameters, a startup focused on deveoping software and technology for the music industry, one of my tasks was to build the company website on the Tumblr platform. Using the Tumblr theme development tools, I built the website with a modular design to accomodate the different designs that were being tested for the site, made a simplified customization interface to more easily be able to update the information on the website, and ensured that the page was responsive across all devices and screen sizes.</p>
                            <p>Through this experience, I learned about the challenges that go into converting a design from a flat PSD image into a real website, and was responsible for building the site under a tight deadline.</p>

                            <h2>iGEM Wiki</h2>
                            <p>For Northeastern University's 2016 iGEM Team, I designed and coded the online wiki, which documented the progress and results of their student-led bioengineering research project. In addition to building the pages, I was also responsible for figuring out how to embed a web app made by another team member into the wiki, which was tricky because it had a lot of dependencies and the MediaWiki servers that the iGEM wikis were hosted on did not allow any external linking of files.</p>
                            <p>This was the first web development project I've done of this scale, ie: with this many individual pages. I learned how to best implement templating to ensure a consistent design across pages without overwhelming myself with code, and collaborated with coders from other teams on the best practices for coding on the MediaWiki platform.</p>

                            <h2>Perfect Party Playlist</h2>
                            <p>At HuskyHacks 2016, a 24-hour hackathon hosted by Northeastern's College of Computer Design, I worked with a team of 3 others to build "Perfect Party Playlist." This was a Python-based Spotify playlist sorter, which sorts songs in a playlist based on attributes found in the Spotify API, such as variance, tempo, etc, according to our own custom Python algorithm. I was responsible for building the front-end and implementing the backend code into the front-end.</p>
                            <p>This was the first project I had built at a hackathon, and my first time working with Flask and with  an API. I learned a lot about how OAuth works, and although the design is a little rough our team was proud that we were able to build a complete, functional project within 24 hours.</p>

                            <p>One of the final assignments for CS 2510: Fundamentals of Computer Science 2, taken in Spring 2016. The goal was to build three island types: a "perfect" pyramid shaped mountain, a diamond mountain of random heights, and an island with randomly generated "terrain" including hills and lakes. The island can be traversed to locate helicopter pieces that must all be gathered and brought to the highest point of the island before the island sinks underwater.</p>

                            <h2>Battleship</h2>
                            <p>Final project for Honors CS, Spring 2015. The project was completely up to us, as long as it was built using Processing, so I decided to build a Battleship game played against a computer "AI" using built-in algorithms. There are two levels of the  AI, an easy mode with the AI firing random guesses, and a hard mode with the AI calculating the probability of specific ship locations using <a href="/http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/december32011/">this algorithm.</a></p>
                            <p>This was the first programming/computer science course I took, so I was really pleased that I was able to build a fully functional game after taking a beginner programming course, and that I was able to implement a relatively complex algorithm into my program.</p>
